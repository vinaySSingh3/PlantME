# PlantME
M. Sc. IT(AI) project 2022

Traditional systems do not have the descriptive ability to represent the information about which plants can survive at specific location. The project focuses on improving factor productivity and competitiveness of crops and plants by providing specific crops or plants for a specific geographical location using Artificial intelligence.
This project is aimed to develop an information application for user to understand which crops or plants to plant as per the geographic location and present review is to highlight the possibilities of a sustainable crop or plant production in region, which is predicted to suffer from increasingly severe drought in the future due to climate changes.
System will save the information of variety of plant. System will predict which plant can be sown as per the weather, latitude, longitude, season, temperature, humidity, previous year data and other factors will be used to estimate which plants can be sown in a certain geographic region. Artificial intelligence will be used to anticipate the optimal produce for a plantation.
