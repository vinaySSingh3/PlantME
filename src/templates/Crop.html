                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Rice is one of the chief grains of India. Moreover, this country has the largest area under rice cultivation. As it is one of the principal food crops. It is, in fact, the dominant crop of the country. India is one of the leading producers of this crop. Rice is the basic food crop and being a tropical plant, it flourishes comfortably in a hot and humid climate. Rice is mainly grown in rain-fed areas that receive heavy annual rainfall. That is why it is fundamentally a kharif crop in India. It demands a temperature of around 25 degrees Celsius and above, and rainfall of more than 100  cm. Rice is also grown through irrigation in those areas that receive comparatively less rainfall.[citation needed] Rice is the staple food of eastern and southern parts of India.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Rice can be cultivated by different methods based on the type of region. But in India, traditional methods are still in use for harvesting rice. The fields are initially plowed and fertilizer is applied which typically consists of cow dung, and then the field is smoothed. The seeds are transplanted by hand and then through proper irrigation, the seeds are cultivated. Rice grows on a variety of soils like silts, loams and gravels. It can tolerate alkaline as well as acid soils. However, clayey loam is well suited to the raising of this crop. Actually, the clayey soil can be easily converted into the mud in which rice seedlings can be transplanted easily. Proper care has to be taken as this crop thrives if the soil remains wet and is underwater during its growing years. Rice fields should be level and should have low mud walls for retaining water. In the plain areas, excess rainwater is allowed to inundate the rice fields and flow slowly. Rice raised in the well-watered lowland areas is known as lowland or wet rice. In the hilly areas, slopes are cut into terraces for the cultivation of rice. Thus, the rice grown in the hilly areas is known as dry or upland rice. The yield of upland rice per hectare is comparatively less than that of wet rice.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The regions cultivating this crop in India are distinguished as the western coastal strip, the eastern coastal strip, covering all the primary deltas, Assam plains and surrounding low hills, foothills and Terai region- along the Himalayas and states like West Bengal, Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, eastern Madhya Pradesh, northern Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. India, being a land of the eternal growing season, and the deltas of the Ganges-Bramhaputra(in West Bengal), Kaveri River, Krishna River, Godavari River, Indravati River and Mahanadi River with a thick set-up of canal irrigation like Hirakud Dam and Indravati Dam, permits farmers to raise two, and in some pockets, even three crops a year. Irrigation has made even three crops a year possible. Irrigation has made it feasible even for Punjab and Haryana, known for their baked climate, to grow rice. They even export their excess to other states. Punjab and Haryana grow prized rice for export purposes. The hilly terraced fields from Kashmir to Assam are ideally suited for rice farming, with age-old hill irrigational conveniences. High yielding kinds, enhanced planting methods, promised irrigation water supply and mounting use of fertilizers have together led to beneficial and quick results. It is the rain fed-area that cuts down average yields per hectare.</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Origin of rice</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Oryza Sativa, it is believed, is associated with wet, humid climate, though it is not a tropical plant.
                                It is probably a descendent of wild grass that was most likely cultivated in the foothills of the far Eastern
                                Himalayas. Another school of thought believes that the rice plant may have originated in southern India,
                                then spread to the north of the country and then onwards to China. It then arrived in Korea, the Philippines
                                (about 2000 B. C.) and then Japan and Indonesia (about 1000 B. C.). When Alexander the Great invaded
                                India in 327 B. C., it is believed that he took rice back to Greece. Arab travelers took it to Egypt, Morocco
                                and Spain and that is how it travelled all across Europe. Portugal and Netherlands took rice to their
                                colonies in West Africa and then it travelled to America through the ’Columbian Exchange’ of natural
                                resources. But as is traditionally known, rice is a slow starter and this is also true to the fact that it took
                                close to two centuries after the voyages of Columbus for rice to take root in the Americas. Thereafter the
                                journey of rice continues with the Moors taking it to Spain in 700 A. D. and then the Spanish brought rice
                                to South America at the beginning of 17th century.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The journey of rice around the world has been slow, but once it took root it stayed and became
                                a major agriculture and economic product for the people. In the Indian subcontinent more than a quarter
                                of the cultivated land is given to rice (20011-12). It is a very essential part of the daily meal in the
                                southern and eastern parts of India. In the northern and central parts of the subcontinent, where wheat is
                                frequently eaten, rice holds its own and is cooked daily as well as on festivals and special occasions. </p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food. The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat (T. aestivum). The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares or 545 million acres, 2014).[5] World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In 2020, world production of wheat was 761 million tonnes (1.7 trillion pounds), making it the second most-produced cereal after maize.[7] Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century.[8] Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet.</p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Origin and history</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Cultivation and repeated harvesting and sowing of the grains of wild grasses led to the creation of domestic strains, as mutant forms ('sports') of wheat were preferentially chosen by farmers. In domesticated wheat, grains are larger, and the seeds (inside the spikelets) remain attached to the ear by a toughened rachis during harvesting.[15] In wild strains, a more fragile rachis allows the ear to easily shatter and disperse the spikelets.[16] Selection for these traits by farmers might not have been deliberately intended, but simply have occurred because these traits made gathering the seeds easier; nevertheless such 'incidental' selection was an important part of crop domestication. As the traits that improve wheat as a food source also involve the loss of the plant's natural seed dispersal mechanisms, highly domesticated strains of wheat cannot survive in the wild.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates.[9] Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals[11] but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids.[12][13] When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Pulses are consumed as Dal, which is a cheap source of plant protein. These are consumed because of body building properties having presence of various amino acids. These also have medicinal properties. By products of pulses like leaves, pod coats and bran are given to animals in the form of dry fodder. Some pulse crops like Gram, Lobia, Urdbean & Moongbean are fed to animals as green fodder. Moong plants are also used as green manure which improve soil health and adds nutrient into the soil.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A number of pulse crops are grown in India and world. Among the crops, major ones are Gram, Pigeonpea, Lentil, Fieldpeas etc. According to history, the origin of Gram is in South West Asia – probably Afghanistan and Persia, Pigeonpea in Africa, Lentil in Turkey to South Iran and Fieldpeas in Mediterranean Region of Southern Europe and Western Asia.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Pulse crops are cultivated in Kharif, Rabi and Zaid seasons of the Agricultural year. Rabi crops require mild cold climate during sowing period, during vegetative to pod development cold climate and during maturity / harvesting warm climate. Similarly, Kharif pulse crops require warm climate throughout their life from sowing to harvesting. Summer pulses are habitants of warm climate. Seed is required to pass many stages to produce seed like germination, seedling, vegetative, flowering, fruit setting, pod development and grain maturity / harvesting.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Varietal Development programme of pulses got strengthened in 1967 with the initiation of All-India Co-ordinated Research Improvement Programme. Through this programme, the varieties suitable for across the country i.e. agro-climatic zones: Northern Hills Zone – J&K, Himachal Pradesh, North West of Uttar Pradesh; North West Plain Zone – Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, western Uttar Pradesh; North East Plain Zone – eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Mizoram, Northern Odisha; Central Zone – Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh; South Zone – Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and southern Odisha have been developed.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">There was 239 lakh ha area in India at triennium ending 2010-11, which was mainly contributed by Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. From this area, 158 lakh tonnes production of pulse was received. The major contributors of this production were Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. During this period, productivity of pulses was recorded as 661 kg / ha with highest in Punjab (905 kg/ha), Haryana (891), Bihar (839), Uttar Pradesh (823) and West Bengal (811).</p>
